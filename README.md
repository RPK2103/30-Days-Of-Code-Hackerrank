##### A challenge to become a better Developer!
Usually it only takes 21 days to form a new habit, this applies to programming also. 
So 30 Days of Code was presented by Hackerrank in order to  help new programmers work on coding fundamentals in bite-sized pieces. Every day for 30 days, we will receive an email posing a challenge for us to code, solve, and submit the solution. As beginner, I really consider this to be a great opportunity for me to brush up my fundamentals and hence build the habit of coding everyday. 
As far as this repository is concerned, it would contain the solution for all the 30 challenges, in Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code. I know there are already a couple of repositories published on github with all of these solutions. I just consider this to be my first step towards building this new habit.
##### Language Used: C++
